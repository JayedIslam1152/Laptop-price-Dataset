# üíª Laptop Price Analysis and Visualization

This project uses the **Laptop Price Dataset** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, investigating the relationship between various laptop specifications and their market price. This is a pure data analysis project and does **not** include any Machine Learning or model building.

## üìñ Project Goal

The primary objective is to discover which features most significantly influence the price of a laptop‚Äîsuch as **RAM**, **CPU Type**, **Storage Configuration**, or **Screen Resolution**‚Äîand to clearly present these relationships through data visualization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The entire analysis is carried out using Python. As per your instruction, the main libraries are:

* **Pandas:** For robust data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Numpy:** For efficient numerical operations.
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For visualizing the relationship between laptop specs and price using attractive charts and graphs.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For step-by-step documentation of the analysis and its results.

## üìä Key Analysis Steps

Within the `Laptop_price Dataset.ipynb` notebook, you will find the following crucial data analysis steps:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Checking data quality, handling NaN values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Splitting columns like `ScreenResolution`, `Memory`, and `CPU` into more meaningful and analyzable features.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the distribution and relationships of `Price` with characteristics like `Company`, `CPU`, `RAM`, and `Inches`.
4.  **Visualization:** Using Seaborn to create histograms, box plots, and bar plots that demonstrate which specifications have the biggest impact on price.
5.  **Key Findings:** Summarizing the main insights or discoveries derived from the data.
